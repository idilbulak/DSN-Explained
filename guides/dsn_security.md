## DSN Security

Ensuring the security of your DSN (Data Source Name) is pivotal to prevent unauthorized access or potential data breaches. This guide provides some common and best practices to make your DSN more secure.

Avoid Hardcoding DSN in Your Code
Storing your DSN information directly in the code exposes the risk of revealing your database details if your code is compromised by malicious actors.

Bad Practice:

$dsn = "mysql:host=localhost;dbname=mydatabase";
$user = "username";
$pass = "password";

Instead, it's preferable to store DSN details in a configuration file or environment variables.

Using Environment Variables

You can use environment variables to store your application's configuration details. This helps shield this information even if your code is viewed by others.

For instance, you might have the following in a .env file:

DB_DSN=mysql:host=localhost;dbname=mydatabase
DB_USER=username
DB_PASS=password
In PHP, to access this information:


$dsn = getenv('DB_DSN');
$user = getenv('DB_USER');
$pass = getenv('DB_PASS');

Encryption
By encrypting and decrypting your DSN details, you can add an extra layer of security. However, this method is often considered overkill and must be done correctly; otherwise, it may introduce security risks.
